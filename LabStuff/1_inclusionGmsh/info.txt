This folder contiains the '.geo' files needed for use of Gmsh to create 1 inclusion meshes.
The names came about when testing different mesh generator methods within Gmsh (4, 5, 6),
but all that matters now is the last number in each file name, which indicates the radius
of the circular mesh (the outer edge radius).
