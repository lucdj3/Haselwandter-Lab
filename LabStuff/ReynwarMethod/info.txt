These files are all meshes created from scratch intended to go directly into Surface Evolver, as in the
Reynwar Method. If the issue with the 'delete edge' command had not arisen, I believe many of these would
be fit for the Reynwar Method, 'FixedProtein14.txt' being latest and greatest. In general, there is no
special naming pattern here, other than the higher the number, the more recent and probably somehow better
in my experience.
