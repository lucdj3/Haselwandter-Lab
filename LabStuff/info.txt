These is the main folder with the bulk of the work done for making the Osman-Lucas method possible.
The contents that are not other folders are largely scripts that are either directly or indirectly
used for the Osman-Lucas method in the 1 or 2 inclusion system. The folders are hopefully semi-self-
explanatory by name, and each additionally has an 'info.txt' document to further explain itself.
One major consideration about the scripts in this folder and the other folders: several of the scripts
automatically append or prepend input or output file names with folders that made my life easier. If
you are having issues or would like to change the folder architecture, make sure to look at the scripts,
notably 'runall.py' and 'tilt_convert.py', to verify that they will still function. Additionally, the
location of Surface Evolver is assumed by 'tilt_convert.py' to be in a folder titled 'Evolver' that
exists in the grandparent of this folder.
