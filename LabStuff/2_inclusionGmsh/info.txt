This folder contiains the '.geo' files needed for use of Gmsh to create 2 inclusion meshes.
The names indicate that each is semi-circular (for mirror symmetry in the 2 inclusion system),
the first number indicates the distance from the mirror plane of the center of the inclusion
(which has radius 1), and the second number indicates the radius of the semi-circular mesh.
Therefore, 'halfring_1.5_1280.geo' is a semi-circular mesh, with the inclusion centered at a
distance of 1.5 from the mirror plane, with an outer radius of the mesh of 1280.
