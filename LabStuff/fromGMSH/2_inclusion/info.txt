This folder contains the files produced by 'runall.py' for the 2 inclusion system, ready for 'tilt_convert.py'.
These files theoretically could be opened in Surface Evolver and their energy minimized, but due to having a
defined polar tilt angle, this reveals quite limited information.
Their naming system is as follows: SE_[contact angle in degrees]_[radius of mesh].txt. So 'SE_1_10.txt' is a
mesh with a contact angle of 10 degrees with the inclusion, and a radius to the outer edge of 10.
